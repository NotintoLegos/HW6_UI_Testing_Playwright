Assignment 6- UI Testing

Reflection:

    The overall impression I got from the Playwright LLM was that it was much earsier than the manual wirting by far. With the first part of the assignment the progress was slow moving as I ran maven and then found error after error that needed adjusting. With the Playwright LLM I only needed one prompt and it was able to make the tests easily. This may have been due to having a usable file already in the test files but regardless I preferred using it to manual writing.

    Using the playwright to follow my path for UI use was very interesting to use. I enjoyed how simple and satisfying it was to use. 

    The issues I had with part A were do to the returning value covering 2000+ lines of code rather than the 1 word to search for on the page block. This kept happening for most of my tests. The other issue was the original expected value would be wrong initially and it was difficult to find the correct value on page while it was cycling through quickly.
